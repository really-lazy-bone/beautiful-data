{"name":"Beautiful-data","tagline":"Visualizer Team [Flickr]","body":"beautiful-data\r\n==============\r\n\r\nThis is an Open Source project that focuses on a large-scale data processing and visualization.  Its ultimate goal is to provide researchers, business analysts and students a framework for doing \"big data\" in relatively short order.\r\n\r\nThe code organization structure is loosely based on (inspired by) Jean-Paul Calderone's python project directory.  Undoubtedly at somepoint we will have to integrate java and other languages/technologies.  At which point, a reasonable refactoring effort is required.\r\n\r\nThe project's official website is at http://bd.pcwerk.com/\r\n\r\n\r\ndirectory structure\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n    lazy-bones-beautiful-data/\r\n       LICENSE\r\n       README.md\r\n       bd_analyze/\r\n       bd_collect/\r\n       bd_store/\r\n       bd_visualize/\r\n       bin/\r\n       website/\r\n\r\nThe bd_ directories contain source code for the four modules of project; the website directory contains the static web-related documents (e.g., .html, .css, and .js files); the bin directory contains wrapper scripts that can be used to execute the project.  In theory, code within the bd_ directories should never be directly executed.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] Calderone, Jean-Paul.  \"Filesystem structure of a Python project\" http://as.ynchrono.us/2007/12/filesystem-structure-of-python-project_21.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
